                Katrina Kaif is currently on the top of the world as her latest film Tiger 3 is performing really well
                at the box office, with the film crossing Rs 200 crore mark. The third installment of the Tiger
                franchise has given her character of Zoya more depth and more roots which would hopefully lead up to a
                solo Zoya film for Aditya Chopra’s Tiger franchise. Things are looking quite exciting at home as post
                Katrina’s film, Vicky Kaushal’s Sam Bahadur is up for release.

                Scientists have discovered fragments of a continent, known as Argoland, in Southeast Asia. These
                fragments were initially part of Australia and have drifted towards the eastern side of Indonesia. This
                continent was once part of a 155 million-year-old landmass that stretched as wide as the United States.
                Eldert Advokaat, an author and geologist at Utrecht University, explained, "We were dealing with islands
                of information, which is why our research took so long." He added that their research spanned over seven
                years.

                <p>Rubina Dilaik’s recent tweet received a lot of backlash online. The actress has posted a tweet
                    saying, ‘To whomsoever it may concern! Diwali is over, stop bursting crackers...’ She further added,
                    “Since 10th November, non-stop crackers are being burnt till 3 am in the morning…enough now… air
                    pollution toh hai hi…Noise pollution is killing our sleeps (sic).”
                    Netizens quickly reacted and started calling her ‘anti-Hindu’ and asked her to delete her tweet.</p>
